    <p>2. The software is distributed as Free To Use But Restricted. This means
    that anyone may use the software for non-commercial usage. In free version
    the python scripts are obfuscated with fixed key, that is to say, everyone

    commercial usage or to obfuscate python scripts by random key, the user must
    purchase a license to continue using the software.</p>

    <p>3. There are 2 basic types of licenses issued for the software. These

        <li><p>A juridical person usage license for business users. The user
